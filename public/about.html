<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Everything you need to know about me will be summarized in a few lines.
  I always consider myself a student who learns everything that I do not know as long as he is able to absorb the information that suits my mind, so to speak.
  Programming or developing websites is one of my interests now, and I am at the beginning of the journey with my wonderful teacher, Angela.
  There are several questions always running in your mind, why am I doing this.
  The answer is simple, although when we get to this question we spend a lot of time answering it because we do not have enough information about it.
  I simply found the answer quickly because I found the reason to learn a new and interesting language. The exciting reason behind this is that you 
  learn a language not to speak it, but to build exciting visual projects with. </p>

<p>My hobby is drawing, and from drawing I chose graphics and photography. Through this, I mastered working on most Adobe programs.
  I am not a professional, but I am happy with the results.</p>

<p>Now what is the next step?</p>
  Continuing to learn programming to successfully reach the stage of developing websites, in addition to my work as a graphic designer.
